MENTION WHAT ARE THE TOPICS/KEYWORDS THAT U HAVE LEARNED IN THIS TUTORIAL:
- Use of Observables
- Use of Observables class with async pipe in template
- map, with pipe
- mergeMap, with pipe
    - with this you can create a list of functions to call one after the other. One function can use the data fetched by another function. 
- switchMap, with pipe
    - same as mergeMap, with the difference that switchMap cancels all other HTTP requests that is running at that point of time
- subscribe
    - works same as observables, with a difference that the data fetched with subscribe cab be used in .ts file 
- in-memory-web-api
    - creates a mock backend
    - here I am just creating the backend URL, not using it 

If you catch data with observables, then you have to use it directly in HTML file with async pipe.
